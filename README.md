# Libary Management System Django

### Problem Statement

    Developed Library Management System using Django framework where an admin can preform CRUID (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations like
          ● Add a Book
          ● Update an entry of a book
          ● Delete a book
          ● Get all books

### Technologies
    Library Management System is based on this packages & languages
          ● Django  
          ● Python  
          ● HTML  
          ● Css 
          ● Mysql 
          ● Mysql-connector-python

### Setup

Check  python version
```bash
python3 --version
```
Clone git repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RutujaGurav07/Libary_manegement_system_django.git
```

Once you've cloned the repository, navigate into the repository.
Create a virtual environment and activate it using the following command
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Once you've activated your virtual environment install your python packages by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Now let's migrate our django project:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```  
If there are no hitches here you should now be able to open your server by running

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```  
project running on localhost

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/welcome/
